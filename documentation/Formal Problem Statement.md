#Formal problem statement (200 words)
Climate Action (SDG 13)

##Definition of the target
Climate change is a change in the common weather found in a location, which can be measured as a difference in how much rain a place usually gets in a year or a change in a location's normal temperature for a month or season.

Disposable cups are forms of tableware and disposable food packaging, which include paper cups, plastic cups and foam cups. The production of paper cups adds to water pollution (when chemicals infiltrate the waterways), the production of foam cups brings in air pollution (when pentane is released into the air) and the plastic-coated paper cups chips in the plastic pollution problem (when disposed as waste). 

Greenhouse Emission refers to the emission of greenhouse-affective gases into the Earth's atmosphere.

##Brief Description
Half a trillion disposable cups are being manufactured annually, consuming lots of energy and producing tons of greenhouse emission.

##Outline of the approach.
-Collection of the left out food from canteen/restaurant stalls
-Sharing to the needy people.
