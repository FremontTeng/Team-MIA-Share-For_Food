# Formal problem statement (200 words)
## Climate Action (SDG 13)

## Definition of the target
Climate change is a change in the common weather found in a location, which can be measured as a difference in how much rain a place usually gets in a year or a change in a location's normal temperature for a month or season.

Leftover food is defined as consumables that remain unused or unconsumed.

Greenhouse Emission refers to the emission of greenhouse-affective gases into the Earth's atmosphere.

## Brief Description
In 2018, the total food wastage generated is up to 763,100 tonnes in Singapore.[[1]] Food waste accounts for about 10 per cent of the total waste generated in Singapore and those that are disposed of go the waste-to-energy plants for incineration.

Our submission aims to reduce the amount of food wastage in NTU canteens/restaurants by collecting leftover food and distributing them accordingly to the relevant needy people organizations.

## Outline of the approach.
### Collection of the left out food from canteen/restaurant stalls
- Gather a list of stalls involved in the project
- Setup daily routine of collecting leftover food by their opening hours
- Check-in system for leftover food

### Sharing to the needy people organizations 
- Alias with the organizations for the food collection
- Include expiry dates for the collected food
